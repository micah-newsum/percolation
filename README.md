- Store sites in byte array
- Each byte will store 3 1 bit values.
- The first bit will represent an open or closed site.
- The second bit and open site connected to the top (full)
- The third bit an open site that is connected to the bottom
- Create a boolean instance variable called percolates. Within the open method, check if system percolates and if so, set percoaltes to true.
- The system will percolate if a site is open, it's full, and it's connected to the bottom.
- open:
    - set open site bit to 1.
    - check if site is in top row. 
        - set isFull bit to 1. 
    - check if site above is valid.
        - check if site above is open.
            - union the two sites. 
        - Check if site above is full.
            - set site to full.
    - check if left site is valid.
        - check if left site is open.
            - union two sites.
            - check if site is full.
                - set site to full.
    - repeat same logic for right site.
    - check if site is in bottom row.
        - set is connected to bottom bit to 1.
    - check if bottom site is open.
        - union with bottom site.
        - check if bottom site in last row.
            - set is connected to bottom bit to 1.
    - check if site is full and connected to bottom.
        - set percolates to true.
